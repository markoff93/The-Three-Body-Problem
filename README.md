# The-Three-Body-Problem

The code presented in this repository was developed during the final project of the Computer Simulations in Physics course at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Physics - Applied and Computational Physics. The overaching goal of this project was to numerically solve the Three-Body Problem using the Runge-Kutta 4th order method and implemente a corresponding interactive simulation in the GlowScript IDE using Python / VPython.

# The-Three-Body-Problem

The code presented in this repository was developed during the final project of the Computer Simulations in Physics 
course at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Physics - Applied and Computational Physics. 
The main goal of this project was to numerically solve the Three-Body Problem using the Runge-Kutta 4th order method 
and implement a corresponding interactive simulation in the [GlowScript](https://www.glowscript.org/) IDE 
using Python / VPython.
